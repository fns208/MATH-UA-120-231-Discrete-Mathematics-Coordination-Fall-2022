\begin{question}
    (Scheinerman, Exercise 24.16:) 
    Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets and let $f: A \rightarrow B$.  Prove that any two of the following statements being true implies that the third is true:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[I.] $f$ is one-to-one
	\item[II.] $f$ is onto
	\item[III.] $|A| = |B|$
	\end{itemize}

	{\it Hints:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Your proof will consist of three parts: (1) If I and II are true, then III is true, (2) If I and III are true, then II is true, and (3) If II and III are true, then I is true.
	\item The pigeonhole principle might help.

    \item Prove that $(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}$.

\begin{question}
        A fair coin is flipped 10 times.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the probability that there are an equal number of head and
            tails?
        \item What is the probability the first three flips are heads?
        \item What is the probability that there are an equal number of heads
            and tails and the first three flips are heads?
        \item What is the probability that there are an equal number of heads
            and tails or the first three flips are heads (or both)?
        \item What is the probability that the first three flips are heads given
            that an equal number of heads and tails are flipped?

\begin{question}
    An unfair coin shows heads with probability $p$ and tails with probability
    $1-p$. Suppose this coin is flipped $2$ times. Let $A$ be the event that the coin comes up first heads and
    then tails.  Let $B$ be the event that the coin comes up first tails and
    then heads.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item  Find $P(A)$.
        \item  Find $P(B)$.
        \item  Find $P(A \mid A \cup B)$.
        \item  Find $P(B \mid A \cup B)$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Explain how one could use this unfair coin to make a fair decision.

\begin{question}
    Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are events in a sample space $(S,P)$.
    Prove or disprove:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $P(A \cap B)=0$, then $P(A\mid B)=P(B\mid A)$ if and only
            if $P(A)=P(B)$.
        \item If $P(A)>0, P(B)>0$ but $P(A \cap B)=0$, then $P(A\mid
            B)=P(B\mid A)$.  If proven, give an example of two such events
            with $P(A) \ne P(B)$.

\begin{question}
    Consider the sample space $S = \{ a, b, c \}$, with equal probability for each outcome. Define the random variables $X$ and  
    $Y$ by $X(a) = -1, \quad X(b) = 0, \quad X(c) = 1, \quad Y(a) = Y(c) = 0, \quad Y(b) = 1.$ 
    Check that $\mathrm{Var}(X+Y) = \mathrm{Var}(X) + \mathrm{Var}(Y)$, but that $X$ and $Y$ are not independent.
