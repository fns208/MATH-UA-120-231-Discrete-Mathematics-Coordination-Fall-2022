Complete the assignment in \LaTeX~  on Overleaf, download the pdf and upload on Gradescope.


\section*{Proof Options}

Please choose \textbf{one} of the following exercises. Begin with ``Claim:" and write the statement you intend to prove. Then write ``Proof:" and the proof. \textbf{Your induction parts (base case(s), induction hypothesis and induction step) should be clearly labeled.} You can choose your own end-of-proof marker for flair.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Prove that for all positive integers $n$, $$ \sum_{j=1}^n j2^j = (n-1)2^{n+1} + 2$$
	\item Suppose you begin with a pile of $n\geq 2$ rocks and split this pile into $n$ piles of
	one rock each by successively splitting a pile of rocks into two smaller
	piles. Each time you split a pile you multiply the number of rocks in each
	of the two smaller piles you form, so that if these piles have $r$ and $s$ rocks
	in them, respectively, you compute $rs$ and add it to the total. Prove that the sum of products equals $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
	\item Exercise 22.17: A flagpole is $n$ feet tall. On this pole we display flags of the following types: red flags that are 1 foot tall, blue flags that are 2 feet tall, and green flags that are 2 feet tall. The sum of the heights of the flags is exactly  $n$ feet. Prove that there are $\frac{2}{3}2^n + \frac{1}{3}(-1)^n$ ways to display the flags.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Grading Rubric}
This assignment will be graded on a scale of 1-10 via the RVF rubric (9 points) discussed in class. More information on this rubric can be found \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P0OBjw-GkX64uCpYcqYmXARapf9MwaiI/view?usp=sharing}{here}. \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KAFQ7GBFpfUkyTBRZ30h5o6nXWwYDSML/view?usp=sharing}{Here} are some examples of past Polished Proof graded work to make sure expectations are clear. The remaining point will be given for the proper use of \LaTeX.
